double click on "party-game installer"
choose "run in terminal"
type in your password, which will enable the installer to:
 --install pygame, a python module
 --make a "party-game.desktop" file, which runs the python 
   script "party.py" when you double click it
 --NOT mess with your computer in any other way ;)
then click on the resulting "party-game.desktop file with 
the icon of the main character, and play the game!
